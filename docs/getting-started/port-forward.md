# Port Forwarding
Allow people from outside your network to access the server

:::danger

**DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!!!**

**PORT FORWARDING CAN CAUSE UNINTENDED SECURITY RISKS TO YOUR COMPUTER**
:::

## Recommending against port forwarding
Its not generally recommended to port forward a computer on your own network. Any vunrability in the code could lead to hackers taking advantage of it and taking personal data. Instead use a reverse proxy, or buy a VPS.

## Routers
Theres alot of routers out there, so this tutorial will not show you how to use the router config settings, but instead tell you what you need to do generally.

## Ports you need to forward
Without these ports being forwarded, the server will not be able to be connected to.
