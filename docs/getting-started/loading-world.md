# Loading a World
Loading a world using karpet


## NOTICE
Karpet **CANNOT** generate more terrain than the one that has already been written to disk. Make sure the world your loading has lots of terrain generated for you to use.

## 1.18 world notice
Due to a bug in minestom 1.18 worlds will fail to load some chunks, its recommended to use a 1.17 world and load it onto the server. You can still play the game with a 1.18 client.

## World Saving
World saving is really easy todo, I just havent added it yet.


## Copying the world file
First, open minecraft and select the world you want to load and click ```Edit```, a screen like below should popup

![Edit World](/img/worldoptions.png)

From here select ```Open World Folder```, copy this folder into the server directory and name it ```world```. Now start the server and the world should be loaded
